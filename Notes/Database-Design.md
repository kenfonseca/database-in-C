You need to know how to store the data inside of the memory
* Not "disk space" memory
* How to store everything "in memory"
* We'll use a Binary Tree

We can store and find values quickly using a Modified Binary (Union) Tree with:
* Node Struct
* Leaf Struct

The goal is to create fast structs based on CPU speed
* Memory wastage is of no concern unless it proves inefficient
