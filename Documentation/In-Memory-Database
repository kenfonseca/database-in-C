The goal is to create a very fast database

In-Memory Databases are not saved to disk
* Restarting the database will clear all data
* RAM memory
* Why use this?
    * It's helpful for caching DB data so we don't need to retrieve data directly from the DB and can read quickly from "temporary atorage"
        * Multiple reads are costly in wbe develeopment
    * It's helpful for session IDs. Everytime a user uses a web browser to connect to a server, they are assigned a session ID as a cookie
        * This info is temporary and must be pulled quickly which is why saving it in a cache makes more sense

The most used in-memory database is "Redis"
* They claim to be the fastest
* We will attempt to make it faster
* And free
